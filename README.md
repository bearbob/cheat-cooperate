# cheat-cooperate
 A small multiplayer game about trust, using NodeJS

 Inspired by https://ncase.me/trust/, this is a game for at least two players to cooperate or betray each other.
 You can also play with more people, were you are assigned a new partner randomly each round.

## Installation

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Download the latest release or the [current state](https://github.com/bearbob/cheat-cooperate/archive/master.zip) of the project
* Run `npm install` in the project folder
* Open `localhost:5000` and run the game! (tip: you need an even account of players, but you can simulate that with multiple tabs)
