# cheat-cooperate
 A small multiplayer game about trust, using NodeJS

 Inspired by https://ncase.me/trust/, this is a game for two players to cooperate or betray each other.

## Installation

* download the latest release or the current state
* run `npm install` in the project folder
* open `localhost:5000` and run the game! (you need an even account of players, but you can simulate that with multiple tabs)
