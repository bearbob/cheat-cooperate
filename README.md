<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Inspired by https://ncase.me/trust/, this is a game for at least two players to cooperate or betray each other.
In each round, you have to decide whether to cooperate with your partner, or betray them (and possibly earn more points).
You can also play with more people, were you are assigned a new partner randomly each round.
A leaderboard shows the player names that currently have the most points. Whether you cooperate or betrayed your partner will be displayed in a chat.
